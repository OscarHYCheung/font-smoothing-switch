# Font Smoothing Switch
Chrome extension for turning on or off webkit-font-smoothing

A CSS class ```chrome-webkit-font-smoothing-switch``` is added to ```<body>``` by default which adds style ```-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased```. A button will be added later to turn on or off this extension.

### Load the extension
Since the extension is not packed and published through Chrome Web Store, Developer mode is needed to be on to load this extension. Check out the instructions here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

### Todo
- [ ] Add button for switch on and off font smothing feature
- [ ] Add setting page for selecting value ```auto```, ```subpixel-antialiased```, or ```antialiased``` for attribute ```-webkit-font-smoothing```
